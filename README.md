Diabetes Prediction Project
Diabetes Prediction is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that helped me take my first steps into the world of ML. Completing this project gave me a strong motivation to explore more in this field.

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on several medical attributes. It uses a Logistic Regression model, which is simple yet powerful for binary classification problems like this.

# Steps Followed in the Project
Importing Required Libraries
We begin by importing important Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.

Data Collection and Processing
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and exploration.

Understanding the Dataset

We inspect the number of rows and columns.

We analyze statistical measures using .describe() to understand the distribution and range of data.

Splitting Data and Labels
The features (inputs) are separated from the labels (outputs) to prepare for model training.

Splitting Training and Test Data
The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.

Training the Model
A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training dataset.

Model Evaluation

Accuracy on the training data.

Accuracy on the test data.

Building a Predictive System
A simple system is implemented to take user input and predict whether the person is likely diabetic.

✨ Conclusion
This project was simple yet enlightening. I enjoyed building it and learned a lot about the basics of machine learning, data handling, and model evaluation. It has encouraged me to take on more ML projects and deepen my understanding.
